        "Before using Breiss' pregelentized rice flakes I was using sushi rice from the local organic food store. I cooked the rice separately for about two hours until it was all &quot;mush&quot;. I then added &quot;rice hulls&quot; to help with the lauterning. I also would hold back the pound of carapils and added this to the rice mash as well. I would time all this so I was adding the rice mash to my regular mash just before vorloof. A lot of hassle and yes, I did have some &quot;stuck&quot; mashes. I've brewed at least 25 batches with the rice flakes and not one stuck mash!"
