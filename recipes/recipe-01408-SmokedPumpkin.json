        "1lb Crystal 40L",
        "2lbs roasted pumpkin (cut pumpkin quarters, roast at 350F for ~30 mins, scoop out flesh from skin)",
        "1oz perle (~8% alpha) 60 mins",
        "1/2 oz fuggle (~5% alpha) 10 mins",

        "I use Muntons English Ale yeast, dried, activated in a starter 12-36 hours prior.",
        "1 stick cinnamon *** ) Add to final hot wort immediately",
        "Star anise (2 stars)*** ) before cooling and leave during fermentation.",
        "** to substitute, about 0.5 lbs peat smoked will give a similar effect, or 2lbs cherrywood smoked from Breiss. I'm not sure how these other malts will change the fermentable sugar though.",
        "*** this will give a mild cinnamon hint, and the anise won't be too noticeable either. Allspice and ginger are other suitable additions, fresh ginger could be mashed too."
