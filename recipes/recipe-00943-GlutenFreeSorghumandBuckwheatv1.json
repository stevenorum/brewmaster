        "8lbs - Liquid Sorghum Malt Extract from Northern Brewers (This may be the Briess liquid extract, but I'm unsure).",
        "12oz of buckwheat I malted and slowly baked at ~120 for a few hours, then cooked at 210 for 40min, 235 for 20 more minutes and finally 250 for another 20 minutes. (I found this never got the degree of color or scent I might have expected, but I'm hoping for something akin to a crystal in effect.)",
        "12oz of buckwheat prepared at 120, then roasted at 400-450 for ~30 minutes. This was a tan grain and started having a toasted nut scent.",
        "12oz of green malted buckwheat, roasted at 525 for 45 minutes. This was a darker brown, but not as dark as a chocolate malt for example.",
        "Hops: 1oz of Hallertauer, 1oz of Tettnanger, 1oz of Amarillo, 1oz of Pacific Ace",
