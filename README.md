Machine learning tools for beer creation and classification.

First step: classify beers into BJCP categories, based on ingredients.

Second step: predict beer ratings, based on ingredients.

Third step: create novel beer recipes, based on BJCP category and desired rating.

Right now I'm ignoring some complexities, including anything called out in the instructions instead of the raw ingredient list.  This means that, for example, this won't consider how long hops are boiled, or whether they're boiled or used for dry hopping.  That can potentially be added later.
